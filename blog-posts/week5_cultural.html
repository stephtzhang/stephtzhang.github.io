			<p>I enjoy pairing because it keeps me on pace with the task at hand. Left to my own devices, I can falling into Stackoverflow void. It's also been instructive to see what other people pay attention to. For example, one of my pairs was really intent on raising errors for possible bad user input. Raising errors felt like an aside to me, but her focus on argument errors showed me that it's a pretty fundamental part of building an object that will interface with other objects or people.</p>
			<p>Communicating online can be difficult and frustrating at times. I always verbalize when I'm looking a method up in the Ruby API or googling an issue my pair and I are having. Nevertheless, it makes for stinted communication that wouldn't exist if we were pairing in person. Pairing online also makes it hard to establish a rapport more generally.</p>
			<p>The feedback was somewhat helpful. Reading my own feedback as well as rating the feedback left by others, I found that the amount of specific and actionable advice is quite low. That could be because we are all relatively new to programming and it's difficult to critique others properly when you're figuring the ropes out yourself. </p>
			<p>Still, I did receive one piece of feedback that was particularly helpful. It described the difference between our two coding approaches and suggested that I get my feet wet a bit more. I have a tendency to research thoroughly before coding, but I should balance that with a bit of trial and error, especially as I become more comfortable with Ruby.</p>
