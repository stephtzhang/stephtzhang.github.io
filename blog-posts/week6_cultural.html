			<p>"Stereotype Threat" is a psychological theory <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk" target="_blank" >developed by Claude M. Steele</a> that explains underperformance by minority groups. He explains that anxiety about being judged for a negative stereotype based on a minority social identity can severely hinder performance in academic applications. </p>
			<p>His original studies compared high performing math undergrads on a difficult math exam. Women grossly underperformed compared to their male counterparts when no introduction was given to the exam. However, when the undergrads were alerted that the exam didn't indicate mathematical ability, the two groups' scores showed no statistical difference. According to Steele, the female undergrads were afraid of confirming the stereotype that women are inferior at math. That anxiety inhibited their performance on the exam unless they were told that the exam could not measure mathematical ability. </p>
			<p>As a queer woman of color, I have experienced anxiety threat in ways both large and small. One example of a smaller manifestation of anxiety threat happened during a recent DBC pairing session. My white male pair totally dominated the exercise. He was navigating while driving, driving while navigating, and talking almost without stop. I became incredibly frustrated and shut down. I didn't want to voice my input or add to the exercise because I felt so devalued in that technical context. In this instance, I knew on an objective level that my pair was simply excited about the challenge and probably had no idea how upset I was becoming when he one-sidedly forged ahead with the exercise, but that didn't stop the emotional anxiety from setting in. </p>
			<p>Although its roots are deep, the solution to stereotype threat starts with us all. We have to create the world we want to live in and that starts with an <a href="http://www.scn.org/friends/ally.html" target="_blank">understanding of the institutional experiences</a> of the people around us. The more empathetic we are to our neighbors, colleagues, and collaborators, the better equiped we will be to recognize when a seemingly harmless comment or action has deeply hurtful implications for another person, not least because fostering diversity has shown time and time again to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ekaterinawalter/2014/01/14/reaping-the-benefits-of-diversity-for-modern-business-innovation/" target="_blank">increase productivity and earnings in the work place</a>.
