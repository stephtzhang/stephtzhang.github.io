			<p>Inheritance and composition are both design techniques to share behavior between different classes. Inheritance models objects in an "is-a" way. Super classes pass their behavior on to sub classes that can be seen as versions or extensions of their super class. </p>

			<p>Composition reverses the structure of inheritence. It models objects in a "has-a" way.  Larger objects are composed by small objects that have single responsibilities. </p>
			<img src="../images/composed_cake.png" alt="An example of composition.">
			<p>In both of the above cases, the sentence "I'm a 10 inch chocolate cake with 3 layers" will print to terminal. However, in each example the characteristics are gained in a different way. Whereas the first example shows ChocolateCake inheriting size and layers from Cake, the second demonstrates Cake being composed in part by the flavor attribute from the Flavor class.</p>
			<p>"Favor composition over inheritance," a <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/composition-inheritance/" target="_blank">widely accepted dictum</a>  from Design Patterns suggests that composition should be used in place of inheritance in most cases. While inheritance is extremely powerful, allowing the extension of a super class' behavior almost ad infinitum, its power becomes a weakness when poorly designed. A sub class that doesn't rightly have an "is-a" relationship with its super class will begin inheriting bad behavior, which will then ripple through any sub classes they may have and any othe classes they interact with. </p>
			<p>Composition, on the other hand, does not depend on a heirarchy of classes. Although it may require more code, its small, well-defined objects can easily be plugged and unplugged from larger objects, making it highly versatile. </p>
