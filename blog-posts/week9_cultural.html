			<p>Stack Overflow has guidelines in place for asking questions. The title has to be at least 15 characters long to ensure that it is somewhat specific and every question must have at least one tag so the question is searchable. In addition, Stack Overflow prompts users to search for the answers to questions before posting and provides formatting suggestions (putting returns between paragraphs and indenting code with 4 spaces for readability). </p>
			<p>These guidelines should be followed when asking any programming question, on Stack Overflow or otherwise. An easy rule of thumb to follow is to put yourself in the shoes of the person answering the question, <a href='http://blogs.msmvps.com/jonskeet/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/' target='_blank'>the Golden Rule</a>, as one coding blogger puts it. </p>
			<p>In week 2 of Phase 0, I had a question about fetching and merging DBC's changes and I didn't follow the Golden Rule. I posted my question in a thread dealing with the same general topic, without specifiying the context in which my problem occured or adding the error I was receiving. My opaque question made it difficult for people to understand my question or provide helpful insight.  In the future, I will include a clear title, a clear description with context, appropriate code, and relevant error messages when I ask programming questions. </p>
