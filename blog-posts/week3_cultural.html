			<p>When I first read through the thinking preferences and dislikes of the four <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">Gregorc thinking types</a>, I felt like a sceptic reading horoscopes. Aspects of all the likes and dislikes seemed to fit my thinking style. This made sense once I realized that everyone shares a bit of each thinking style, but tends to lean towards one of the four categories: Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Abstract Random, or Concrete Random.</p>

			<p>My thinking style shows that I'm a Concrete Random thinker with a fair amount of both Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random thought and very little Abstract Sequential thinking:</p>

			<p>As a Concrete Random thinker, I tend to hone in on direct information, as opposed to abstract concepts. I also organize information in chunks that I link randomly, rather than in logical trains of thought.</p>

			<p>Within the context of DevBootcamp's Phase 0, I've thrived on working from home independently. However, I need to focus energy on getting the most out of my pairing sessions because I'm naturally inclined to tackle problems by myself, an approach with definite limitations. I've also been challenged at times with tasks I find overly formalized like the Code Combat exercise this week, in which we had to write out painstaking pseudocode as opposed to quickly coding the solutions. I need to re-orient the way I view formalized tasks, perhaps by timing myself and creating a competitive environment between myself and the timer.</p>
