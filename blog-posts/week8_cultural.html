			<p>Dr. L. Nathanson <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf" target="_blank">outlined four directions</a> on "The Compass of Shame," designating the different diffensive stances we take in reaction to shame. Unless we are able to regain equilibrium after experiencing humiliation, we withdraw, attack ourselves, avoid the issue, or attack others. </p>
			<p>Understanding your own tendencies among the four directions may allow you to moderate your response to future experiences of shame. Ultimately however, greater respect forms the only solution to bypass these diffensive stances altogether, so that we can regain a strong sense of self after a humiliating moment.</p>
			<p>Many researchers have applied the study of humiliation to overcoming multicultural conflict. Samir S. Basta <a href="http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/BastaNY10meeting.pdf" target="_blank">describes the propogation of violence and anti-social attitudes in French immigrant families due to an overarching feeling of shame</a>. Children in these families grow up as outsiders whose parents speak a different language, wear different clothes, and often hold menial jobs because better employment is unavailable to them. Basta details that these children often rebel (attacking others), but that most eventually "lower their heads" and except their plot (withdrawal). </p>
			<p>As a first generation American, I have experienced some, but not all, of the specific style of shame that Basta outlines. Growing up, I remember one instance distinctly, when I recited my name at the end of the dress rehearsal for our first-grade play. "Stephanie Zhang," I said proudly, grinning (with the "Zh" pronounced as a soft "Dj" according to the correct Mandarin pronunciation, the way we always said it at home). "Zzzang," my first-grade teacher interrupted, as I sat expectantly on the auditorium stage with the entire class. My pulse quickened, I didn't know what to do. I knew I had pronounced my name correctly, wasn't it my name after all? But she was my teacher and the entire class was looking at me now. I lowered my eyes, withdrew from the moment, and dutifully echoed back, "Stephanie Zzzang." </p>
			<p>Fast forward many years to a staff meeting in the dramatic dining room of a four star restaurant. "What is respect?" our garrulous general manager booms. The entire staff stands at attention around him, contemplating the simple question, but unsure how to respond. Then, chaos ensues. One faction believes that respect ought to be earned painstakingly, another smaller group thinks that it's an inherent right. In a bustling dining room, it is perhaps more pressing than in any other environment to respect your peers. But true respect can never be achieved unless everyone has a shared understanding of what it means. </p>
			<p>According to the Oxford Dictionary, <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/respect" target="_blank">respect means both</a> "A feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements" and "Due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others." The group at the restaurant that held every ounce of respect must be earned were drawing from the first definition, the type of respect reserved for major accomplishments. The group that viewed respect as a fundamental right were thinking of the second definition, the base line of respect upon which human dignity is built.</p>
			<p>Without a conscious effort to extend this base line repect to every person, including ourselves, the actions that create moments of shame will be propogated ad infinitum. We must act with due regard for the feelings and traditions of others and assume that others are acting in like.</p>
