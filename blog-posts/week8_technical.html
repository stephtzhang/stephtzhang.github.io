			<p>Web security risk grows relative to the number of users who access a site or application and the value of the information that passes through it (ie financial or identity information). For that reason, many young applications do not prioritize security. The chief marketing officer at Webroot  <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/cheap-apps-lack-of-inbuilt-security-leaves-mobile-environment-vulnerable-webroot/" target="_blank">describes</a>, "There is a threshold there where the malware writers feel like they can monetise and make some good return on investment to go after that group of users, and that is the point where we have to go look at it seriously." </p>
			<p>Controlling user input and using a web scanner are two fundamental ways to protect a site or application. </p>
			<p>Any interaction with users that accepts input opens a site to vulnerabilities. To prevent users from inserting malicious code into an application, you can call the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/a2a4yykt%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" target="_blank">HtmlEncode method</a>. HtmlEncode renders user-supplied information as static text, so that any malicious code that is inputted will not be interpreted. </p>
			<p>In situations where you would like user input to trigger an action, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/zdh19h94%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" target="_blank">use input to set parameter values</a> rather than directly accepting potentially malicious code. </p>
			<p>While an ideal world would allow limitless resources for maintaining a site or application's security, regularly using one of many available <a href="http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246988/Web%20Application%20Security%20Scanner%20List" target="_blank">web scanners</a> to test your code is a very effective starting point. These scanners find weaknesses by performing common attacks.</p>
			<p>Web scanners cannot protect a site or application against newly developped hacking strategies, however known hacking techniques are <a href="http://www.beyondsecurity.com/web-security-and-web-scanning.html" target="_blank">far more likely to occur</a> than unknown ones because of the cost and time necessary to find new vulnerabilities. </p>
