			<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> really inspired me. I appreciate that the same rough and tumble mentality that created Dev Bootcamp is still alive. I'm hopeful that the group I'll be joining will have the same drive and energy as the first cohort Shereef described, excited to grow personally and as a community. I'm looking forward to having a cohort of passionate individuals who can support and inspire me, as we're all going through an enormous change in our lives. I'd like to foster that sense of community by being proactive with the support and inspiration I offer to others.</p>
			<p>Initially, my expectations of DBC were a bit hazy. I liked the emphasis on the empathetic side of coding, but I didn't understand how that was put into practice. I'm definitely nervous to start the process of DBC, but I know I can channel that nervous energy in a positive direction.</p>
