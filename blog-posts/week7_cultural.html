			<p>One of the more important life lessons I learned working in restaurants is to say hello, goodbye, and thank you to everyone I work with every day. As simple as it sounds, these small moments of positive interaction create a much larger sense of compassion.</p>
			<p>Once you've established that human connection, differences don't disappear, but you have built an environment to talk about those differences. Last week, I wrote about <a href="week6_cultural.html">stereotype threat</a>, a theory that explains the underperformance of minority groups in areas where they are societally viewed as inferior (ie women in math). I think the adoption of compassion as a core value, would behoove communities, academic, corporate, and otherwise, in mediating stereotype threat. When viewed as a person with a distinct set of interests and anxieties, rather than as a member of a minority group, individuals who might otherwise face stereotype threat may begin to thrive.  </p>
