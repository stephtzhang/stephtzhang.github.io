			<h1></br></br>Thinking Through Design Thinking</h1>	
		</header>

		<article>
			<p>For this exercise, I chose three sites with design that I personally enjoy.</p>
			<p><b>Atavist</b></p>
			<p>I like this site because it's gorgeous and it has a trove of high quality writing designed for digital consumption. From the homepage, my eyes are definitely drawn to the selection of stories currently available for purchase. They're presented in different sized divs that collectively dominant the homepage without feeling overwhelming. This is definitely the most important area of the site because Atavist exists to distribute these stories. White dominates the color scheme, with soothing periwinkle accents. I would describe the site as simple, whimsical, light-hearted, soothing, and fun.</p>
			<p>The website bridges the gap between writing and multimedia. It sells short stories, many from well-respected authors, that have beautiful typeface, gorgeous photos as headers for every chapter, and hyperlinks to historical photographs and audio recordings. I would describe the content as eclectic, adventurous, imaginative, forward-thinking, but grounded in literary tradition.</p>
			<p>The navigation is simplified by displaying only stories, books, subscribe, and sign in as option on the top nav bar. For the vast majority of users this is what all they would want to see in the site. However, at the footer there is an about us nav bar that includes our story, people, jobs, media, faq, and contact. This both simplifies and complicates the user experience: it simplifies it for most users who only want to look at different stories to purchase, but it complicates it for anyone who wants to learn more about the company.</p>
			<p><b>Sandlands Vineyards</b></p>
			<p>This is a great site because simple, beautiful, and succinctly packed with all the geeky information you'd want to know about this producer's wines. The home page is a a single photo of a black and white vista of the vineyard with the winery's name and a centered nav bar. When I go onto a winery's website, it's always to get information about one of their wines. The centered nav bar at the top of the homepage with wines as the first item allows me to do that seamlessly.</p>
			<p>This website provides detailed information about their wines that educated consumers and wine professionals seek. For each wine, it has a photo of the label, a photo of the specific vineyard that wine came from, as well as a succinct, but fact-packed paragraph detailing the wine. I'm talking about age, elevation, and soil type of the vineyards, fermentation technique, and length of aging and aging container. All that combines to a fine-grained depiction of why the wine tastes like it does. I would describe the content as informative, succinct, technical, practical, and helpful.</p>
			<p>It's extremely easy to navigate through the site. One big reason for that is that they simply don't have much content and don't need to have more content than they do. It would be nice to be able to navigate from one wine to the next without returing to the wine page.</p>
			<p><b>Medium</b></p>
			<p>This is another simple, beautiful site. My eyes are drawn in a straight line down the homepage, reading through all the trending articles on the site.  I would describe the website as elegant, simple, uncluttered, soft, and whimsical.</p>
			<p>This website gives normal people a platform to publish all sorts of different stories in a place where many people can access them. The content is crowd-contributed writing. I would describe the content as eclectic, variable, literary, informative, and reflective of the many different writers.</p>
			<p>I generally don't go to medium looking for a specific story, but rather to explore different stories. A search bar at the top of the page let's you look for a specific story or topic you may have in mind and after finishing a story, another is suggested. It's easy to navigate through the site, but it's probably impossible to browse through all the content on the site, since there's so much.</p>
