			<p><b>History of the US patent</b></p>
			<p>Patent law was created in early US history to encourage development in the new country by attracting technologically skilled foreigners. At the turn of the 19th century, when US patent law first took effect, the population was low and land abounded. Granting limited monopolies for inventions was one way to <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/podcast/2009/jan/20/0x05/" target="_blank">attract technologically skilled people from abroad</a>, especially the Huguenots who were fleeing religious persecution from France at the time.</p>
			<p><b>Problems with patents today</b></p>
			<p>The development goals that led to the original creation of the US patent do not match our current situation in the least. The 20-year monopoly granted by patents <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/07/17/332205119/evaluating-the-benefits-and-costs-of-patents" target="_blank">slows innovation by locking up ideas</a>. This is especially apparrent in the realm of modern software technology because it changes so quickly. A 20-year patent assumes that the lasting benefits of an innovation will extend beyond that limited span. However, as software develops at such a fast rate, patents allow software innovations to be monopolized for the entire span of their usefulness to society. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/patent_report.pdf" target="_blank">a recent White House report</a> shows that suits brought by Patent Assertion Entities (more commonly known as patent trolls) tripled from 2011 to 2013. This slows innovation even more by entangling innovators in legal battles and keeping them from continuing to innovate. </p>
			<p><b>Solutions</b></p>
			<p>Changes to the US legal system never come easily, but in regards to patents, they may be possible if they are made in small increments. A mandatory cost/benefit analysis of all inventions pending patent could more accurately assess the length of a patent to be granted. For example, instead of offering blanket 20-year patents, small software innovations could have patent monopolies of a few years, whereas more impactful innovations could keep the two-decade long term. </p>
