		<p>I have two layouts here. One for a normal screen size and another for a smaller screen size that I determined once I started resizing the browser with my content to find natural breakpoints. As you can see, the normal screen size assigns a grid class to the header, nav, and description div. In the smaller layout, I changed the different percentage widths of the grids all to 100.</p>
