					<p></br><b><i>Blind tasting is the main way sommeliers hone their palates. It involves deducting the grape, region, and vintage of a wine without knowing in advance what it is.</i></b><p>	
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h1>Sight</h1>
					<p>The appearance of a wine can give you clues before you even smell or taste it. Pay attention to the hue and viscosity.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h1>Nose</h1>
					<p>The human nose can detect <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/human-nose-can-detect-1-trillion-odours-1.14904">1 trilion</a> different odors. The aromas in a wine can be very telling for that reason. We'll walk through the categories of aromas and flavors in a second.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h1>Palate</h1>
					<p>Once we've reached the palate, we already have some key information from the site and nose of the wine. Assess whether the palate confirms what you've found so far.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h1>Fruit</h1>
					<p>Ask yourself what fruits you smell and taste. For whites, are they tree, stone, citrus, or tropical? For reds, are they red, blue, or black? What condition the fruit is in: underripe, overripe, bruised, or baked?</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="box">
					<h1>Non-Fruit</h1>
					<p>This category includes florals, spices, and herbs. Certain wines have extremely distinct non-fruit aromas. If you're picking up cured meat and black pepper, chances are you're tasting Syrah.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="box-container">
				<div class="box">
					<h1>Minerals</h1>
					<p>Do you sense inorganic minerals like stones or organic minerals like earth and mushrooms? If the wine is low in minerality, it's important to note that too.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h1>Structure</h1>
					<p>For the acid, alcohol, and tannin levels of the wine rate it on a scale from low to hi. This is the part where you get to use fancy vocabulary like medium plus acid.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
					<p>Decide whether the wine is from the Old World (Europe) or New World (anywhere else). Old World wines are higher in acid and minerality and lower in alcohol. Now select a grape and vintage.</p>
